## Introduction

This is a light-weight, powerful implementation of a virtualized
table, based off `react-window`. Why Window Table?
* Supports HTML5 table tags
* Tiny footprint - ~10kB
* Easy to customize - Custom tags, class names and what not

## Alternatives
* [React Fluid Table](https://mckervinc.github.io/react-fluid-table/#/),
a drop in replacement for window-table with a ton of more features.
* [React Base Table](https://autodesk.github.io/react-base-table),
a library which also offers a ton more features, with a slightly different API.

## Looking for contributions
I, the author of this library, have been unable to provide support for the issues opened in the library
in the past few months. Contributions highly appreciated.
